# Babilon v3 — Architecture Diagram & Implementation Roadmap

**Purpose:** A complete, actionable blueprint to evolve *Babilon Trade Bot* into a hybrid AI-driven trading system (sentiment + market signals), with milestones, file layout, data flow, and implementation tasks.

---

## 1. Overview

Goal: turn the repo from a FinBERT + rule system into a production-ready hybrid signal engine that:

* Combines sentiment and market features
* Trains lightweight ML models and ensembles with rule logic
* Backtests with realistic market constraints
* Executes safe paper trades with risk controls
* Provides monitoring, retraining, and observability
