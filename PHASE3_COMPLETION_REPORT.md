- ✅ **Momentum Indicators**: RSI, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, Williams %R
- ✅ **Volatility Indicators**: ATR, Bollinger Bands, Historical Volatility
- ✅ **Volume Indicators**: OBV, VPT, Volume ratios and momentum
- ✅ **Trend Indicators**: ADX components, price position, regime detection
- ✅ **Market Regime Features**: Trend strength, regime classification
- ✅ **Feature Importance Weights**: Predefined weights for ensemble models

### 2. NER-based Relevance Filter (`logic/ner_filter.py`)
- ✅ **Entity Recognition**: Multi-method approach (spaCy, Transformers, Regex)
- ✅ **Ticker Mapping**: Comprehensive mapping of 20+ tickers to company entities
- ✅ **Relevance Scoring**: Weighted scoring system for news-to-ticker mapping
- ✅ **News Processing**: Batch processing of news articles with relevance filtering
- ✅ **Sentiment Integration**: Combined sentiment analysis with ticker relevance

### 3. Feature Store Builder (`logic/feature_store.py`)
- ✅ **TA Feature Integration**: Automated TA feature computation for all tickers
- ✅ **Sentiment Feature Integration**: News sentiment aggregation by time periods
- ✅ **Feature Combination**: Merging TA and sentiment features with derived interactions
- ✅ **Data Cleaning**: Robust handling of missing values, infinite values, and duplicates
- ✅ **Feature Store Structure**: Organized parquet files by feature type (ta/, sentiment/, combined/)

### 4. Phase 3 Execution (`phase3_runner.py`)
- ✅ **Automated Pipeline**: Complete execution pipeline with dependency checking
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging throughout
- ✅ **Validation**: Feature quality validation and summary reporting
- ✅ **Sample Data**: Created sample news data for testing and demonstration
